	# Scope contains all targets saved in check_create_suggestion when try_create_important_action was executed,
	# as well as all special actor, recipient etc targets specified in try_create_important_action.
	# Scope root is the player.
	effect = { }

	score = {} #MTTH to check how good the suggestion is based in different criterias. Score determines the target of a multi-target suggestion.
	
	weight = {} #MTTH used to sort the importance of suggestions to the current character. The highest value will be the first suggestion to be attempted for creation. If a suggestion type has less than 0 weight then it will not be considered for creation.
